    <h2 id="fire-and-fury-like-the-world-has-never-seen">&ldquo;fire and fury like the world has never seen&rdquo;</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I had the chance to visit South Korea this summer and it&rsquo;s too bad that it&rsquo;s known mainly for the unfriendly neighbor that lives up North. Granted, there <strong>is</strong> an angry man armed with ICBMs capable of leveling the peninsula there but I&rsquo;d be lying if I said I felt as much animosity and tension as the media convey when I was at the <strong>physical border</strong> between the two countries.</p>

    <p>I bet you came here for the DMZ but S. Korea is so much more than that. Even with its gorgeous national parks and seemingly ubiquitous wifi, our attention goes to the country only when the US is conducting drills there with Korean soldiers or when Kim Jong Un has issued another threat to the White House. And <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ugJZhL-cbc">some of our citizens</a> don&rsquo;t exactly know where North Korea is on a map. Sure, it is cherry-picked but the writers at Jimmy Kimmel sure know which questions to ask people on the streets of LA.</p>

    <p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s a summary of my visit to the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) and JSA (Joint Security Area). But before you read any further, take a look at this image (no I didn&rsquo;t turn up the saturation; Korea is just <strong>that</strong> green). It&rsquo;s called Reunification Bridge and it represents hope for a united Korea, one in which all mistakes are forgiven and there is hope for an Earth at peace, something that becomes harder and harder to attain when our president talks about unleashing &ldquo;fire and fury like the world has never seen&rdquo;.</p>

    <br>
    <p>S. Korea has really monetized on this DMZ thing. And for good reason. Where else in the world can you look at a totalitarian dictatorship from which important exports like juvenile bigotry and nuclear arms capture the media on a regular basis?</p>

    <p>We booked the trip about a week before and they take care of you for the whole day from about 8AM to 5PM. We had to provide credentials like passport and other ID so the government of South Korea and the UN know that you&rsquo;ll be there. The first part of the tour is through the infiltration tunnels that North Korea built. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/02/world/asia/north-korea-dmz-tunnels/index.html">Only four have been found</a> so far but the South suspects that more are still hidden. At first, N. Korea denied building them. Then they discovered that holes for the TNT in the mines were pointed at the South. The North responded by saying they were mining coal. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_Tunnel_of_Aggression#cite_ref-ssd_5-0">There was never any coal in the area to begin with</a>. The theory is that the North was building an array of tunnels to attack the South in unison. It&rsquo;s logistically impossible now with the amount of infantry placed at the border but I guess it was feasible when they were building them.</p>

    <br>
    <p>The mines were built a while back though and there isn&rsquo;t much happening since the country opened them up for tourism. But in order to find them faster, the Koreans developed a fast and efficient way of tracing vibrations. PVC pipes were filled with water and an explosion by the North would give away the general location of the digging. You might think that the sound would give it away. However, 7 meters deep is far enough to be masked by the ground. One such pipe is pictured below in the 3rd Tunnel of Aggression.</p>

    <p>Anyways, beyond the mines is the JSA, or Joint-Security-Area. This is where things got bloody on the 23rd of November in 1984. Vasily Yakovlevich Matuzok, a Soviet translator positioned in Pyongyang defected when his handlers were distracted. What followed was a firefight between officers in which <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1984/11/25/us-says-defector-will-not-return/d9ad244d-16a1-4e86-a343-fb3dcd987aaf">4 were killed and 2 injured</a>. Violence like this is rare but is also an indication of how hostility between the countries can increase abruptly.</p>

    <p>You might have seen the JSA in the movies and documentaries. Well, here it is.</p>

    <p><img src="/assets/img/from-dmz-to-seoul-to-jeju/jsa.jpg" alt="JSA" /></p>

    <p>If you make weird or hateful gestures, the soldiers pictured (and those to my left and right) will quickly put an end to that. If you turn your camera around and take a photo of the South, you will be accused of spying and the soldiers pictured will take your camera. And God forbid you attempt to run across or even approach the concrete border because the soldiers will be upon you before you even get a chance to move a muscle.</p>
